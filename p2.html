      <p>
        This piece was part of an artistic exercise called "Lost and Found". I was paired up with a peer to bring a description of an item that they lost in the past back to life by way of code.

        The description my partner gave me was as follows:

        A cute round-faced white creature with two adorable ears and a yellow nose, no mouth, and a big red bow on her left ear; sometimes it can be pink, too! She has three whiskers on each side of her adorable face. She has so many friends who are all cute and are part of her adventures. She is an icon, she is a legend, and she is.. everything to some of us. :D Her message is about friendship and finding joy; she loves exploring the world.
      </p>

      <p>
       After coding for the second time ever I'm realizing that code drawing is about recognizing patterns and knowing how to calculate symmetry. I found that my Lost object was rather symmetrical so all I had to do was flip the X value on some shapes and I was able to pinpoint the desired point in order to flip the image. Also I realized if I was lost when trying to draw a line or something similar its sometimes best to just draw at line on the canvas and it would be easier to pin point where you want the line to go from there.
