   In collaboration with my two colleagues, Nicole Liu and Roshni Kumaravel, we applied the iconic surrealist technique known as "Exquisite Corpse" to produce this final coded design. Individually, we each sketched a figure comprising a head, torso, and lower half. Once our sketches were finished, we divided them into three sections and exchanged them amongst ourselves. In a random assembly process, we were then challenged to bring these parts together into an entirely distinct character using code. This is how "Ice Cream Cat" came into existence, born from my own unique combination.

        Ice Cream Cat's Origin Story
      </h1>

      <p>
   Once upon a sunny day in the magical land of Dessertopia, there lived a delightful little Ice Cream Cat named Sprinkles. Sprinkles had soft gray fur and a whimsical ice cream cone for a tail, making her quite the unique kitty in the candy-filled world.

Every day, Sprinkles would wander through the candy cane forests, playing with her gummy bear friends and slurping up puddles of melted ice cream. But what set her apart was her special tail, which could change into any flavor of ice cream she wished.

      This was my first attempt at translating someone else's drawing into p5.js. It was an interesting experience that felt like a return to basics, as I had to reacquaint myself with basic shape elements in order to accurately recreate my partner's sketches. I found that working with functions was easier than I had anticipated, and I consider them a nice way to organize different sections of code. Overall, it was a lot of fun to see how the final coded design turned out.
