      <p>
 The data portrait presented here is titled "Vapes on the Ground." Over the course of one week, I embarked on a photographic documentation mission using my iPhone, capturing images of every discarded vape I encountered while navigating New York City on foot. Walking has long been my primary mode of transportation, a central element of my daily routine. Lately, I couldn't help but be struck by the sheer abundance of these diminutive, plastic-looking devices strewn across the city's sidewalks.

The data visualization above is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. With a simple click of the mouse, you'll be transported to a coherent montage featuring photographs of the vapes I came across on each day of this endeavor. By clicking the mouse, you can seamlessly explore the vapes I encountered on my walks on different days, providing a visual narrative of this journey.

        Reflection

      <p>
      Throughout the documentation process, I found myself increasingly astounded by the sheer volume of these discarded vapes strewn across the landscape of New York City. The simple act of paying close attention to my surroundings revealed an astonishing reality: once I began actively seeking these colorful plastic rectangles, they seemed to emerge everywhere, almost as if they had been hiding in plain sight. This experience triggered profound reflections on the relationship between our trash and human interaction and culture.

Indeed, it made me contemplate how changes in human behavior can significantly alter our patterns of waste disposal. It's impossible not to draw a parallel with the past, envisioning a time, perhaps 50 years ago, when countless cigarette butts were scattered throughout the city in a similar fashion. This reflection highlights the evolving nature of our urban landscape and how it mirrors shifts in societal behaviors and norms.
