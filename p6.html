   What does it mean to translate a lenticular print into a piece of code? In this intriguing experiment, my aim was to transform a static image into a vibrant, dynamic work of art. Lenticular art, to me, serves as a poignant symbol of human perception. Just as the image on a lenticular print changes with your viewing angle, our individual perspectives are uniquely nuanced and distinct. I opted for an image of the universe to encapsulate this powerful metaphor, illustrating how every living being's viewpoint within it is one-of-a-kind and unparalleled.

      I've always found optical illusions incredibly captivating. To me, they serve as a vivid reminder that every individual's perspective is inherently unique. My inspiration for this piece was drawn from the work of Nazia Fakhruddin, who has delved into the art of crafting optical illusions through code. Her insightful body of work served as a foundation, and with one of her previous projects as a guide, I fine-tuned each line of code to align with the specific parameters I sought in order to achieve the desired effect.
